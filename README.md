# SemEval2020
Code for SemEval2020 conference paper

This code was tested on Google Cloud Compute Engine N1 high memory (26G) instance of Linux Ubuntu 18.04 with added GPU Tesla V100 running Cuda (for help on adding GPU to your Cloud instance see this SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53415180/gcp-error-quota-gpus-all-regions-exceeded-limit-0-0-globally)

To run test code you will need to install some basic software like Pip3 (see https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-18.04/) and Cuda (see https://gist.github.com/ingo-m/60a21120f3a9e4d7dd1a36307f3a8cce):

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
...

```

After Cuda installed you should execute the Setup.sh from the above repository:

```

```
